# Master's Thesis: Energy Demand Forecasting

## Investigating Climate and Economic Predictors for Energy Demand Forecasting

### Overview

This thesis explores the integration of climate and economic variables as predictors for energy demand forecasting. By combining meteorological data with macroeconomic indicators, the research aims to develop more accurate and robust forecasting models that capture the complex drivers of energy consumption.

### Research Objectives

- Identify key climate variables (temperature, humidity, solar radiation, etc.) that influence energy demand patterns
- Analyze economic indicators (GDP, industrial production, energy prices, etc.) as predictors of consumption trends
- Develop forecasting models that leverage both climate and economic data
- Evaluate model performance across different time horizons and geographic regions

### Keywords

Energy demand forecasting, climate predictors, economic indicators, machine learning, time series analysis
